GUI Framework: Java Swing

Something like a terminal that acts like a simplified version of gedit.

paint rect on screen

two meta options:

open and save

each line is an array (Or look into rope data type, that might work)

state management stuff:
  cursorLocation will be array.index

model class for key
  char output
  int length

design font myself? might be fun

assign char values to keys 

key onclick produces assigned char value at cursorLocation && cursorLocation++

how will I handle soft wrapping?

maybe in state management determine with math and modulus how many grid boxes are able to fit in the width of the line

if length of the working array is greater than maxGridLength then create new array, place it beneath currentLine and cursorLocation is the new location 1, 1

in state management when moving arrow up or down, remember the max y coordinate in array for line. If the latest char output in a given line array is at a smaller
index than the remembered max y coordinate, then go there. Otherwise, go to the remembered y coordinate
